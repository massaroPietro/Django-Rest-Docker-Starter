# How to Contribute

Always happy to get issues identified and pull requests!

## General considerations

1. Keep it small. The smaller the change, the more likely we are to accept.
2. Changes that fix a current issue get priority for review.
3. Check out [GitHub guide][submit-a-pr] if you've never created a pull request before.

## Getting started

1. Fork the repo
2. Clone your fork
3. Create a branch for your changes

This last step is very important, don't start developing from master, it'll cause pain if you need to send another change later.

## Submitting a pull request

Once you're happy with your changes and they look ok locally, push and send send [a pull request][submit-a-pr] to the main repo, which will trigger the tests on GitHub actions. If they fail, try to fix them. A maintainer should take a look at your change and give you feedback or merge it.
